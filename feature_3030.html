<p class="c0 c2 c1">Hey There Shepherd…</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">Another special person with Blue Jay blood running through her veins is out there changing the world…</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">Shepherd grad Mallory Walton is going to Nepal! She is going to be teaching the English language to students there. A place where their people live on about $14 a month or .50 cents a day…</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">And she is doing this voluntarily. All on her own.</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">Help?</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">Yes you can… there is a page at HelpFundMe where you can donate if you feel the need…</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">And every dollar helps… $1, $5… nothing is too small.</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">Help change the world through a Blue Jay named Mallory???</p>

<p class="c0 c1 c2">Hello! My name is Mallory Walton and I’m a senior at Central Michigan University double majoring in music and political science with a focus on international relations and comparative politics. Right now I’m waiting on admission to a university in New York City where I will pursue a Master of Arts in International Affairs, concentrating on security and conflict resolution. Ideally, I would love to find a job with the United Nations or the State Department as a foreign service officer, or even an NGO (nongovernmental organization) that specializes in humanitarian relief after I receive my masters degree.</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">I’m actively involved in organizations like Amnesty International, a group dedicated to bringing attention to and ending human rights violations around the world, and the Michigan Federation of College Democrats, where I serve as vice president and membership director of, respectively. During my time at Central Michigan University, I’ve been section leader in the Chippewa Marching Band for two years, been a member of Model United Nations, served as a proxy member for the Student Government Association, and am currently part of a program called Conversation Partners which pairs native English speakers with international students to help them learn, interact, and make friends. Last year I was an intern for the Mark Schauer for Governor campaign, the democratic candidate who ran against Governor Rick Snyder. I was fortunate enough to be able to study abroad in the summer of 2014 in Rome, Italy, and got the chance to visit seven other countries in Europe including Greece, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and several more.</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">So now that you know who I am today, I’ll share with you a little bit of my backstory. I was raised in Shepherd, Michigan, a small farming community of about 1,500 just five miles south of Mount Pleasant. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at school in Shepherd and was active in many sports as well as student council, class office where I served as class president for a few years, quiz bowl, band, National Honor Society, and many other organizations and clubs. When I was a senior I was given the opportunity to go to Germany to study, which is when the travel bug inside of me was really ignited and I was exposed to a whole different world.</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">Even during my years at Shepherd I couldn’t help but wonder what else was out there and how I, just one in 7 billion people, could make an impact. So here I am, preparing to spend a summer teaching English to impoverished children in a very rural region of Nepal, a small country tucked away in the Himalayas between China and India. Nepal is a developing nation with extremely high poverty levels. To give you some perspective, many people in Nepal live on just $14 per person per month, which is less than 50 cents per day. Education levels are not high and much of the population is illiterate. Infrastructure necessary for schools is lacking and essential resources are nowhere to be found. I’m constantly looking for ways to give back to humanity because I believe it’s my duty as a capable, privileged person and this is my first step in doing so.</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">Unfortunately, being a college student means I don’t have an abundance of money and plane tickets are rather expensive. That’s why I’m asking for your help in raising $1,500, or some fraction of that to help offset the cost of my plane ticket and the necessary transportation within Nepal. I will be donating my time, energy, and skills to help the children of Nepal and the program I am part of provides me with two meals per day and a homestay with a Nepalese family. But because the cost of airfare is so high, it’s the volunteer’s responsibility to cover the costs associated with it. I cannot begin to express how grateful I am to anybody and everybody that contributes, and even to those of you who have made it this far down the page! I apologize for the long-winded explanation but I wanted to give people who don’t know me a chance to find out who this person asking for your money is!</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">Again, thank you to everybody for taking the time to read this story and for those of you who will help me get to Nepal and make a difference in the lives of children. An educated youth has the ability to transform society and they are Nepal’s greatest chance at overcoming many of the obstacles the country faces today and has faced for years. The money you contribute will not only help me cover the costs of my airfare, but it will ultimately help the children of Nepal who will be given a chance to get educated and break free from the impoverished life that many of them are tied to.</p>

<p class="c0 c2 c1">Thank you and namaste as they say in Nepal!</p>
